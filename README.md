# StarAI: Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is a [7 week course](https://sites.google.com/view/starai-course-beta/lessons-preview) by Sydney Machine Learning covering value based RL and policy based methods, and is hosted at Microsoft Reactor [Sydney](https://twitter.com/hashtag/reactorsydney), which is one of 5 spaces newly commisioned by MS for meetups, startups, lectures, workshops, all kinds of coomunity outreach stuff.

- daveglover - cloud developer advocate at MS and IOT coder provided the space
- Steven is a PySC2 whiz - [fund him here to sly down to Sydney](https://www.gofundme.com/steven-brown-to-sydney-for-pysc2)

All discussion is over at the [course forums](http://forums.starai.io/).
